### Master Project: Mini E-Commerce System (3 Products)

Build a simple shopping system:

#### 1. Product Catalog
Create exactly 3 products with: name, price, category, stock quantity, rating

#### 2. Shopping Cart
- Create cart with 3 items
- Each cart item has: product name, quantity
- Calculate total by checking each item

#### 3. Discount System
Use if-else for discounts:
- Check category of first product
- Check category of second product
- Check category of third product
- Apply appropriate discount for each

#### 4. Checkout Process
- Add up all three product totals
- Check if total > 2000 for free shipping
- Add shipping cost if needed
- Apply coupon code using if-else

#### 5. Validations
Check stock for each product:
- Is first product in stock?
- Is second product in stock?
- Is third product in stock?

#### 6. Final Bill
Display:
- Product 1: name, price, quantity, subtotal
- Product 2: name, price, quantity, subtotal
- Product 3: name, price, quantity, subtotal
- Total before discount
- Discount amount
